# Learning Log

- Added an explicit TOOLING.md contract to make skills executable with MCP/API access checks.
- Updated SEO skill flow to verify tooling first, then execute recipes with graceful fallbacks.
- Added Shopify execution guidance (theme repo PR preferred, Admin API fallback) for sprint workflows.
