# Learning Log

- Added dry-run support to the SEO skill sync script (rsync itemized changes).
- Confirmed the sync script in this repo is `blyzr-squad/scripts/sync-openclaw-skill-seo.sh` (SEO skill sync), not mission-control.
- Ran a dry-run sync; no changes listed, so the SEO skill is already in sync.
