# ClawsCrew — Project Memory

## Purpose
Create and evolve the **ClawsCrew** project with a Technical Minimalist design system and a Mission Control dashboard aesthetic.

## What We’ve Learned (so far)
- The visual language is **technical minimalist**: flat 2D, no shadows, strict hairline borders.
- Typography hierarchy is strong and oversized for hero/landing, with monospaced labels throughout.
- Color system anchors on Paper/Forest Green with Coral/Mint/Gold as targeted accents.
- Micro-interactions should feel **snappy** (0.1s), linear ease-out.
- Images use luminosity blend with a hover reveal to full color.
- Layout favors **generous negative space** and a 32px padding baseline.

## Key Artifacts
- `design system.md` in repo root contains the full spec + components.
- **Root learning file:** `/LEARNING.md` — refer to it before adding new UI patterns.

## Next steps
- Apply the system to Mission Control layout (nav + kanban + live feed).
- Build reusable component snippets into a `components/` directory.
- Document decisions as they evolve (update this file).
